<h2>Async / Await in Angularjs applicationn</h2>

<h4>Fetch</h4>
<p>
  when you click on the fetch, the data will be retrived using promise
  implementation.
</p>
<p>
  as angular js can handle promises, the data will be reflected in the view.
</p>

<h4>Fetch Async</h4>
<p>
  when you click on the fetch async, the data will be retrived using async/await
  implementation.
</p>
<p>
  as angular js can't handle async/await, the data will not be reflected in the
  view. but you can see the console, to make sure data came from server.
</p>

<h4>Fetch Async (digest)</h4>
<p>
  when you click on the fetch async(digest), the data will be retrived using
  asynd/await implementation.
</p>
<p>
  as angular js can't handle promises, the data will nont be reflected in the
  view. So we manually trigger the digest so that we can intimate angular the
  data has been changed, thus reflecting changes in the view.
</p>
<hr />

<div>
  You can open your console to see whether data came or not when button clicked.
  and view reflects as above.
  <p>
    It is always better to refresh the page, while clicking the button, to
    understand properly.
